## ðŸ“– Dependencies

- [Web Reactive](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.0.x/reference/html/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux): it
  is a non-blocking web stack to handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware
  resources.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com): is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
  Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas
- [Testcontainer with mongodb](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/mongodb/): some comparison
  between [embed x testcontainers](https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/fast-stable-mongodb-tests-spring/)
